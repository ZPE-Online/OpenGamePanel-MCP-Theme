What is Master Control Program?

The MCP is a project started by ZPE-Online Ltd which has been influenced by either other projects, life experiences and personal interests of ZPE-Online founders. Some of these influences come from the following: Resource Based Economy Projects: https://www.thevenusproject.com/ Tron Films: 1st Film: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron 2nd film: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron:_Legacy Nikola Tesla: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla

The Master Control Program theme is integrated from the ZPE-Online Website and represents different aspects of the mentioned influences, from the "Grid" in the Tron films to the energy lines and energy "Grid" for Nikola Tesla to the name of the project "MCP" combining both the venus projects notion of "intelligent management" of resources not influenced by one individual or group of people, and the Open Source Project which ed dillenger in Tron tries to take control of.
